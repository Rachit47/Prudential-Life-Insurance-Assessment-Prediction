# Prudential-Life-Insurance-Prediction
Prudential is one of the largest issuers of life insurance in the USA.
In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.
Only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance. Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

The assessment involves predicting the risk factor for the company while giving health insurance for the applicants based on their medical history. Four different methods were used to predict the risk: Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree , Random Forest & Adaboost Technique.
